# Algorithm Efficiency Mini Project

Private repo name: `algo-efficiency-mini-project-`  

This project compares the **time and space efficiency** of classic algorithms using
Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
It includes:

- Fibonacci (naïve recursive and dynamic programming)
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Binary Search
- Graphs for execution time comparison

## 1. Project Structure

- `README.md` – Project description and instructions  
- `.gitignore` – Ignores virtual env, cache, and notebook checkpoints  
- `Algo-efficiency-mini-project.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook  
  - Contains all algorithm implementations  
  - Code to measure time and memory  
  - Graphs for comparison

> (If you add more files like `algorithms.py`, update this section.)
